#  Enterprise Network Infrastructure Project (CCNA)

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the documentation for our final **CCNA** project, completed as part of the @Information Technology Institute (ITI) 9-Month Cloud Architecture program.

The project involved the comprehensive design, configuration, and implementation of a secure, scalable, and highly available **enterprise-level network** architecture spanning multiple branches. This practical exercise demonstrated proficiency in core routing, switching, and security protocols.

###  Key Objectives Demonstrated

* Ensuring high availability and gateway redundancy using HSRP.
* Implementing efficient and scalable dynamic routing with OSPF.
* Applying security best practices through VLAN segmentation and secure access control (AAA/SSH).
* Maximizing Layer 2 redundancy and bandwidth utilization (EtherChannel).

##  Network Technologies Implemented

The successful completion of this project required configuration of the following technologies and protocols across the entire infrastructure:

| Technology/Protocol | Functionality Achieved |
| :--- | :--- |
| **VLAN Segmentation** | Logical separation of departments to enhance security and traffic management. |
| **Inter-VLAN Routing** | Implemented using Router-on-a-Stick for effective communication between segments. |
| **EtherChannel (LACP/PAgP)** | Provided link aggregation for increased bandwidth and redundancy between switches. |
| **OSPF** | Deployed dynamic routing protocol for efficient path calculation and fast convergence across branches. |
| **HSRP (First Hop Redundancy)** | Guaranteed gateway redundancy to ensure network high availability. |
| **PVST+** | Configured Per-VLAN Spanning Tree for optimal Layer 2 stability and load balancing. |
| **NAT (Static)** | Published internal servers (Web/FTP) securely for external access. |
| **DHCP with Helper Address** | Centralized, automated IP address assignment for network hosts. |
| **AAA & SSH** | Enhanced network security through centralized authentication and secure remote device management. |
